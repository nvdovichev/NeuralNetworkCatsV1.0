# NeuralNetworkCatsV1.0
L-layer Neural Network for classifying cat images from non-cat images.
Activation functions, forward propagation and back propagation are manually implemented.
Relu is used for hidden layers, sigmoid is used for output layer.
Cross-Entropy as a Loss Function.
The number of layers is a hyperparameter and is specified in the file TrainNN.py
TrainNN.py trains parameters and writes them to a file weights.pkl
Using TryYourImage you can upload an image and find out if there is a cat on it
